HeartBleed DotNet
=================

Drawing on the great work of others, and the disturbingly simple PoC attack, I wanted to write a .NET implementation so that I could run the PoC against some embedded devices running IPv6 only, and in a windows environment where I couldn't (or couldn't be bothered) installing python or go.

I hope this is of use to someone else.
